## I. Project Overview
**Objective:** Develop an AI-Driven Merchandise Customisation Platform that allows real-time product customisation and visualisation. By leveraging generative AI, we can produce realistic product images on demand, allowing customers to personalise items without requiring pre-made inventory. This enhances customer experience, improves inventory management, and increases competitiveness for e-commerce merchants.

**Problem Statement:** Despite the increasing demand for customised products, traditional e-commerce models struggle to offer real-time personalisation as they rely on pre-made inventory product images. This restricts customers from customising items according to their preferences. Ultimately, this affects customer satisfaction, missed sales opportunities, and inefficient resource usage.

**Industry context:** The AI-driven customisation market is expected to grow from $525 billion in 2025 to $639 billion by 2034, reflecting a major shift toward individualised shopping experiences. Unlike traditional AI-powered recommendations, our platform will give users direct control over product design, creating a more engaging and tailored shopping journey.

**Why It's a Problem:** This project addresses key challenges such as inventory waste, lack of instant design previews, and limited automation in customisation workflows. With AI-generated designs and on-demand production, we can reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and enable e-commerce businesses to scale effectively.
