## About Our Data
### Data Source
Our platform uses the **Amazon Fashion Metadata** and its **5-core** data subset from [**Amazon Review Data (2018)**](https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html), released by Jianmo Ni at UCSD. These datasets provide key product information and user reviews relevant to fashion items. 
The curated data is used to enhance the real-time product customization and visualization experience on our platform, as well as inventory management and pricing optimization.

### Data Dictionary
The data dictionary provides a structured overview of the original dataset and the transformed tables we created, detailing column names, data types, and descriptions.

##### 2. `base`

#### Synthetic Data Tables
##### 1. `inventory`
This table contains product inventory data, derived from `base`.
| Column Name      | Data Type | Description                           
|:----------------|:---------:|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `asin`           | Object    | ID of the product                                           |
| `base_price`     | Float     | Base price of the product                                   |
| `stock_level`    | Integer   | Stock quantity of the product                               |

| `lead_time_days` | Integer   | Number of days required to replenish stock of the product   |
| `storage_cost`   | Float     | Cost of storing the product                                 |

| `avg_rating`     | Float     | Average rating of the product                               |

This dataset simulates realistic inventory characteristics for a list of products (asin). Each feature is generated using a distribution that mirrors typical business scenarios:

- base_price: Estimated from product ratings â€” higher-rated products tend to be priced higher, with some added randomness.

- stock_level: Simulated using a Poisson distribution, suitable for modeling inventory counts.

- reorder_point: Random integers between 18 and 25 to reflect when restocking should be triggered.

- lead_time_days: Follows a log-normal distribution, modeling the fact that most shipments arrive quickly, but a few take much longer.

- storage_cost: Generated with a Gamma distribution, rightskewed to represent varying storage expenses: that most products will have low to moderate storage costs, and only a few products will have very high storage costs.

- material_cost: Also Gamma-distributed but with higher expected values, as production materials generally cost more than storage.
